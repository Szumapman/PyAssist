2,"A large section of the railway infrastructure between Minami-Kesennuma Station and Rikuzen-Togura Station, including tracks, stations, and railway bridges, were badly damaged or destroyed by the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. Destroyed stations include Minami-Kesennuma (except for the platform)[1] and Shizugawa Station, as well as various others. As a result of the catastrophic damage to the line and prohibitive costs of restoration as a railway, JR East officially proposed the line's conversion into a dedicated bus rapid transit (BRT) route on 27 December 2011.[2] At present only the Maeyachi to Yanaizu section is operated as a railway, with services on the balance of the route provided by buses.",2023-12-11 13:58:54,2023-12-11 13:58:54,
